## Extracting emotion from faces

What are these guys feeling?

<img src="img/obama.jpg" height=200pix/>

<img src="img/trump.jpg" height=200pix/>

Can AI tell us?

```{python}
from pliers.extractors import GoogleVisionAPIFaceExtractor

obama_img = 'img/obama.jpg'
trump_img = 'img/trump.jpg'

ext = GoogleVisionAPIFaceExtractor()

obama = ext.transform(obama_img).to_df()
trump = ext.transform(trump_img).to_df()

print(obama['angerLikelihood'])
print(obama['joyLikelihood'])
print(trump['angerLikelihood'])
print(trump['joyLikelihood'])
```
